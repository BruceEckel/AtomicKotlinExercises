----------------------------------Exercise 1----------------------------------

Implement a function `abs()` that returns the absolute value of its parameter.
Use `eq` to test it in `main()` using the arguments `0`, `42`, and `-239`.

----------------------------------Exercise 2----------------------------------

Implement `sum(a, b, c)` to return the sum of its three integer parameters.
Test it using both `eq` and `neq` with at least five different argument
combinations.

----------------------------------Exercise 3----------------------------------

Use Test Driven Development (first write a failing test, and then write the
code to fix it) to calculate the area of a quadrangle. The starter code
already contains some tests and your task is to add more. Start with the
sample code and fix the intentional bugs.
