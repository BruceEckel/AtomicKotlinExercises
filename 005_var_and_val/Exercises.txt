----------------------------------Exercise 1----------------------------------

Define a `val answer` and set its value to `42`. On the next line, try to
reassign `answer` to `43`. What error does Kotlin produce? Fix the error by
replacing `val` with `var`. Display the value of `answer` on the console.

----------------------------------Exercise 2----------------------------------

Define `var a = 10`. Now define a `val b = a`. Now assign `42` to `a` and
display both `a` and `b` on different lines.

----------------------------------Exercise 3----------------------------------

Define two `var`s: `x` and `y`. Swap their contents. First try `x = y`, `y =
x`, then fix the erroneous solution:

var x = 1
var y = 2
// Perform swap here
println(x) // 2
println(y) // 1

Your code should remain unchanged for different initializers, like `var x =
"first"`, `var y = "second"`. Thus, using `x = 2`, `y = 1` is not the expected
solution.

HINT: You may need to introduce a third auxiliary `val`.
